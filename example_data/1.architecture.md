# Architecture

This document provides an overview of Eir's technical architecture, guiding principles, and key decisions that support our telehealth platform.

---

## 1. High-Level Overview

Eir’s platform is composed of several integrated components:

1. **Front-End Layer**

   - Web app (React/Next.js) for browser-based consultations and patient dashboards.
   - Native mobile app (React Native) offering real-time video consultation features.

2. **Back-End Layer**

   - Microservices framework (ASP.NET Core) providing RESTful APIs.
   - Auth service leveraging IdentityServer4 for secure authentication and authorization.
   - Data processing services for analytics and reporting.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**

   - Hosted primarily in Microsoft Azure.
   - Kubernetes (AKS) for container orchestration.
   - Azure SQL and MongoDB for structured and unstructured data, respectively.
   - Integration with Azure Storage for patient records and files.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions for building, testing, and deployment triggers.
   - Automated QA testing integrated into PR workflows.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Security First**: All personal health data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2 or above) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Privacy & Compliance**: The architecture adheres to GDPR requirements and relevant healthcare data protections (e.g., HIPAA for US integration scenarios).
- **Scalability**: Microservices and container orchestration ensure we can scale specific services as demand grows.
- **Modularity**: Each service handles a well-defined domain or function, enabling independent deployment and streamlined maintenance.

---

## 3. Front-End Architecture

### 3.1 Web Application

- **Framework**: React (with Next.js for SSR)
- **State Management**: React Query for asynchronous data fetching and caching.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent design across devices, plus custom healthcare-themed UI components.
- **Video Consultation**: Integrated WebRTC-based solution for live streaming between patient and provider.

### 3.2 Mobile Application

- **Framework**: React Native
- **Platform**: iOS & Android
- **Offline Capabilities**: Basic offline caching for storing appointment info and notifications.

### 3.3 Shared Libraries

- **UI Library**: Shared design system components to maintain brand consistency.
- **Utilities**: Common validation rules, formatting, and analytics event tracking used across apps.

---

## 4. Back-End Architecture

### 4.1 Core Microservices

1. **Appointment Service**

   - Schedules and manages appointments, time slots, and cancellations.
   - Communicates with Payment and Notification services.

2. **Medical Records Service**

   - Stores patient records in Azure SQL, with metadata in MongoDB.
   - Manages read/write permissions for healthcare providers.

3. **Auth & Identity Service**

   - Uses **IdentityServer4** for OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
   - Issues JWT tokens for authorized API calls.

4. **Notification Service**

   - Sends email, SMS, or push notifications about appointment updates, reminders, or lab results.

5. **Payment & Billing Service**
   - Integrates with third-party payment gateways and insurance systems.
   - Handles invoices, receipts, and policy claims.

### 4.2 Common Patterns

- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for client apps to interact with the microservices.
- **Message Broker**: Azure Service Bus to handle asynchronous events (appointment confirmations, record updates).

---

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 5.1 Cloud Environment

- **Provider**: Microsoft Azure (primary region: West Europe).
- **Container Orchestration**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for each microservice.
- **Databases**:
  - **Azure SQL** for structured data (users, appointments, billing).
  - **MongoDB Atlas** for unstructured data (notes, large attachments).

### 5.2 Monitoring & Logging

- **Azure Monitor** for application insights and performance metrics.
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

### 5.3 Networking & Security

- **Virtual Network (VNet)** for internal traffic.
- **Application Gateway & Firewall** for inbound traffic, DDoS protection.
- **Secrets Management** with Azure Key Vault for storing credentials and certificates.

---

## 6. Scalability & Reliability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Each microservice container can scale independently based on load metrics.
2. **Redundancy**
   - Active-active cluster setup in AKS.
   - Multi-zone replication for Azure SQL and MongoDB.
3. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Automated backups and frequent snapshot policies.
   - Secondary deployment region (North Europe) for failover.

---

## 7. Security & Compliance

- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted both at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS).
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access for staff, doctors, and admins.
- **Auditing**: Detailed logging of system events to track who accessed which records and when.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: The platform meets Norway’s health data requirements and can align with international regulations (GDPR, HIPAA).

---

## 8. Integration with Third-Party Systems

- **EHR Systems**: FHIR-compliant APIs for exchanging patient information with external electronic health record systems.
- **Insurance Providers**: Custom B2B integrations for claims submissions, policy checks.
- **Payment Gateways**: Stripe or Klarna for credit card or invoice-based payments.

---

## 9. CI/CD Pipeline Details

1. **Git Workflow**
   - Feature branches merge into `main` after code review and automated checks.
2. **Build & Test**
   - GitHub Actions runs unit tests, integration tests, and linting on pull requests.
3. **Deployment**
   - Kubernetes manifests are updated automatically on successful builds of `main`.
4. **Environment Promotion**
   - Dev → Staging → Production, with manual approvals at each step.

---

## 10. Future Architectural Considerations

- **AI Modules**: Potential addition of an AI triage or symptom-checker service using large language models (LLMs).
- **Edge Computing**: Exploring edge deployments for remote clinics in underserved regions for enhanced reliability and lower latency.
- **Serverless Functions**: Offloading certain tasks (e.g., notification triggers) to Azure Functions for cost-effective scaling.
